Features
Connect to various databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
Execute raw SQL queries and use parameterized queries
Handle transactions
Error handling and logging
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
SQLite3 (or other DB API compatible libraries)
SQLAlchemy (for ORM)
psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL)
MySQL Connector/Python
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd yourproject
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start using the database functions, you can run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
You may need to modify the database configuration in config.py before running the script.

Examples
Connecting to SQLite
python
Copy code
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
connection = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)''')

# Insert a record
cursor.execute('''INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES (?)''', ('Alice',))

# Query the table
cursor.execute('''SELECT * FROM users''')
print(cursor.fetchall())

# Commit changes and close the connection
connection.commit()
connection.close()
Using SQLAlchemy
python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)

# Create an engine and a session
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Add a new user
new_user = User(name='Bob')
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()
